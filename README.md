# **CleanRAT**

## **Detailed Abstract**

CleanRAT is a Rust-based, modular Remote Administration Tool designed for ethical red team simulations and cybersecurity training. Drawing inspiration from state-sponsored adversaries (e.g., APT41 and similar groups), CleanRAT replicates advanced threat techniques in a controlled environment. Its primary C2 channel leverages the Google Drive API to store and retrieve encrypted command filesâ€”allowing its communications to blend with legitimate cloud traffic.

Key aspects include:

- **Secure Communication:**  
  - TLS/SSL (with trusted certificates) combined with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) for dynamic key exchange using RSA/ECDHE.  
  - AES-256-GCM encryption of all data (including configuration files using AES-CFB for flexibility) to ensure end-to-end confidentiality.

- **C2 Channel via Google Drive:**  
  - The RAT client polls a designated Google Drive folder at randomized intervals.  
  - Encrypted command files are uploaded/downloaded, simulating a covert C2 channel that mimics routine cloud file activity.

- **Advanced Evasion & Persistence Techniques:**  
  - Anti-reverse engineering measures: code obfuscation, binary encryption/packing, and runtime polymorphism.  
  - Anti-debugging techniques (detecting tools like OllyDbg/x64dbg) and in-memory execution to minimize forensic artifacts.  
  - Techniques such as DLL sideloading/hollowing and Windows Fibers are integrated to execute shellcode stealthily.
  - Self-integrity checks and anti-tampering routines trigger self-destruction and cleanup if modifications are detected.
  - Persistence mechanisms include process injection, registry modifications, and service installation.

- **Functional Capabilities:**  
  - Keylogging, screen capturing, clipboard monitoring, file exfiltration, and remote command execution.  
  - Steganography (e.g., hiding commands via whitespace encoding) further obscures malicious communication.

CleanRAT is built to simulate real-world advanced persistent threat (APT) operations in a safe, isolated environment, providing realistic scenarios for both red team exercises and blue team training.

## **Modules Involved & Their Details**

1. **Communication Module:**  
   - **Google Drive C2 Integration:**  
     - Uses the Google Drive API to upload/download encrypted command files.  
     - Implements OAuth2 (or service account authentication) and polling at randomized intervals.  
     - Supports port knocking and IP restrictions to allow only authorized clients.
   - **TLS/HTTPS Communication:**  
     - Utilizes Rustâ€™s `tokio-rustls` (with trusted certificates) for encrypted channels.  

2. **Encryption & Key Exchange Module:**  
   - **AES-256-GCM Encryption:**  
     - Secures data transmission and payload encryption.  
   - **RSA/ECDHE Key Exchange:**  
     - Facilitates secure exchange of AES session keys with support for Perfect Forward Secrecy.

3. **Evasion & Anti-Analysis Module:**  
   - **Code Obfuscation & Polymorphism:**  
     - Employs compile-time and runtime obfuscation techniques to alter binary signatures dynamically.  
   - **Anti-Debugging & VM/Sandbox Detection:**  
     - Detects and responds to debuggers (e.g., OllyDbg, x64dbg) and virtualization environments.  
   - **In-Memory Execution & Process Injection:**  
     - Loads payloads exclusively in memory and performs DLL sideloading/hollowing to avoid disk artifacts.
   - **Windows Fibers:**  
     - Uses fibers for shellcode execution, bypassing traditional thread-based detection.

4. **Payload & Functional Module:**  
   - **Keylogging, Screen Capture, Clipboard Monitoring:**  
     - Captures and encrypts sensitive data from the target system.
   - **File Exfiltration & Remote Command Execution:**  
     - Facilitates extraction and uploading of files and remote shell operations.
   - **Steganography:**  
     - Hides commands/data using whitespace encoding (or similar techniques) within benign files.

5. **Persistence & Self-Destruction Module:**  
   - **Persistence Mechanisms:**  
     - Implements registry modifications, scheduled tasks, and service installation for long-term access.  
   - **Self-Integrity Checks & Anti-Tampering:**  
     - Continuously verifies binary integrity and triggers a self-destruction routine if compromised.
   - **Remote Update Capability:**  
     - Supports silent, automated updates of the RAT components.

6. **C2 Server Backend Module:**  
   - **Rust-based Backend:**  
     - Provides a secure, scalable command-and-control server running on Ubuntu (or Docker) with HTTPS.
   - **Management Interface:**  
     - Offers a CLI or web-based dashboard for red team operators to dispatch commands and monitor RAT activity.
   - **Logging & IP Restrictions:**  
     - Enforces connection policies and logs all RAT client interactions for auditing and training purposes.
